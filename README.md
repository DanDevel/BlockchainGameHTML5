a simple html5 game on Blockchain


Whats on Blockchain?
- the user data and the token (altcoin) created for use as a payout coin (GTKX1) on this game. ( but you can use as as altcoin on any exchange on ETHEREUM blobkchain) 

 ===== The GTKX1 Coin:
  Its an Altcoin ||| created by me, especially for this game :) ||| , that runs on Ethereum Block chain. So youse an >>> Ethereum Account to trade your coin or receive payouts from the game.

 ===== Blockchain communication:
 
  i used Ganache to generate a local blockchain for this game project. You can change the conection parameters to any other provider you may want :).
  GANACHE: https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
  
  
 ===== Development environment:
 
  Remix IDE:
  https://remix.ethereum.org
   Use Remix to develop the blockchain contracts using solidity language.
  
  VS CODE:
  
 1 - Use VS Code to develop the game with JavaScrip and HTML5 
 2 - Use web3.js library to connect on Blockchain
 
  
 See the working game on prints folder:
 
 
 If you know how to use Ganache, Remix thats ok. if you have any issue contact me ok.
 
 Thanks
