# BlockchainGameHTML5
a simple html5 game on Blockchain


Whats on Blockchain?
- the user data and the token (altcoin) created for use as a payout coin (Game TokenX1 - GTKX1) on this game. ( but you can use as as altcoin on any exchange on ETHEREUM blobkchain) 

 ===== The GTKX1 Coin:
  Its an Altcoin (Game TokenX1 - GTKX1) (ERC20.sol) ||| created by me, especially for this game :) ||| , that runs on Ethereum Block chain. So youse an >>> Ethereum Account to trade your coin or receive payouts from the game.

 ===== Blockchain communication:
 
  i used Ganache to generate a local blockchain for this game project. You can change the conection parameters to any other provider you may want :).
  GANACHE: https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
  
  
 ===== Development environment:
 
  Remix IDE:
  https://remix.ethereum.org
   Use Remix to develop the blockchain contracts using solidity language.
  
  VS CODE:
  
 1 - Use VS Code to develop the game with JavaScrip and HTML5 
 2 - Use web3.js library to connect on Blockchain
 
  
 See the working game on prints folder:

 You can use the game 2 ways:
 
 1 - The game and GTKX1 Coin (ERC20.sol) in two diferent contracts:
 
     - Deploy the contract "game_no_crypto_payout.sol" to "install the game on Blockchain"
  
 2 - The game and the GTKX1 Coin (Game TokenX1 - GTKX1 / ERC20.sol) on the same contract
     - Deploy the contract "GameToken.sol"

 Points:
 
 1 - If the user reaches >1000 <2000 points its points jumps to 2500 points!
 
 Game TokenX1 - GTKX1:
 
 2 - Use the ERC20.sol (Game TokenX1 - GTKX1) contract to send GTKX1 Coin to the player according the rule you may use, mostly if you're using the game contract in the 1st way shown on instalation section above.
 
 
 If you know how to use Ganache, Remix thats ok. if you have any issue contact me ok.
